  One of the most embarrassing objects I own is my diary. Maybe that’s how everyone with a diary feels? And mine’s not even a diary. The cover tells me it’s a FIVE YEAR MEMORY BOOK. It has gilded edges, a peach colored book ribbon, and a self-seriousness I can't bear. Each dated page is broken up into five sections so that someone, in this case me, can see what they were doing a year ago, then two, then three, then four, so long as they keep going. This also means that a day’s entry can’t really run longer than a few sentences. As someone who’d previously never kept a diary beyond a week, that seemed doable.
